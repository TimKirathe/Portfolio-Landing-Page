          <p class="card-body">Hello there! My name is Timothy Kirathe. I am 18 years old, born and bred in Kenya. I recently graduated high-school from Brookhouse with Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry as my A-Level subjects and decided to take a gap year before proceeding to study Computer Science in university. Currently I am taking the Moringa School Prep course remotely and this webpage is my first Independent Project. When I am not occupied by academic studies, I enjoy playing basketball, football, going to the gym, reading and playing the guitar as my hobbies.</p>
          <p class="card-body">So far my experience at Moringa School has been good. Only having completed one week I still have a lot left to experience but it does excite me. For a while I have been very interested in computers and at an early age I had already started to teach myself how to code. I plan to study Computer Science in university and this course at Moringa School will not only give me an advantage over the rest of my peers but also help me explore my passion for creating things using code. I find that already creating simple webpages using HTML and CSS has been very fun and I <strong>cannot</strong> wait to find out just how much more I can do!</p>
